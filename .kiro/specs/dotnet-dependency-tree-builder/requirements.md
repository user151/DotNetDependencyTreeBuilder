# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a .NET C# console application that analyzes C# and Visual Basic projects within a directory structure to build a dependency tree. The application will traverse nested directories to discover all projects, analyze their dependencies, and generate an ordered list of projects that can be used by build scripts to ensure proper build sequencing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want to provide a directory path containing C#/VB projects, so that the application can discover all projects regardless of their nesting level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a valid directory path THEN the system SHALL recursively traverse all subdirectories to find project files
2. WHEN the system encounters .csproj files THEN the system SHALL include them in the project discovery
3. WHEN the system encounters .vbproj files THEN the system SHALL include them in the project discovery
4. WHEN the user provides an invalid or non-existent directory path THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF a directory contains no project files THEN the system SHALL report that no projects were found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want the application to analyze project dependencies, so that I can understand the relationships between projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system finds a project file THEN the system SHALL parse the project file to extract dependency information
2. WHEN a project references another project via ProjectReference THEN the system SHALL record this as a direct dependency
3. WHEN a project references NuGet packages via PackageReference THEN the system SHALL record these as external dependencies
4. WHEN a project file is malformed or unreadable THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue processing other projects
5. IF a project references another project that doesn't exist in the scanned directory THEN the system SHALL flag this as a missing dependency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want the application to generate a dependency tree, so that I can visualize project relationships and build order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all projects have been analyzed THEN the system SHALL construct a dependency graph showing project relationships
2. WHEN the dependency graph is complete THEN the system SHALL detect circular dependencies if they exist
3. WHEN circular dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL report them as errors with specific project names
4. WHEN the dependency tree is built THEN the system SHALL perform topological sorting to determine build order
5. IF no dependencies exist between projects THEN the system SHALL list all projects as buildable in parallel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want the application to output an ordered list of projects, so that I can use this information in my build scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dependency analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL output projects in dependency order (dependencies first)
2. WHEN projects have no interdependencies THEN the system SHALL group them as parallel buildable
3. WHEN outputting the build order THEN the system SHALL include full project file paths
4. WHEN the output is generated THEN the system SHALL provide both console output and optional file output
5. IF the user specifies an output file path THEN the system SHALL write the ordered list to that file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want clear command-line interface options, so that I can easily configure the application's behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the application without arguments THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions
2. WHEN the user provides the --help flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed help information
3. WHEN the user specifies a source directory THEN the system SHALL use that as the root for project discovery
4. WHEN the user specifies an output file THEN the system SHALL write results to that file
5. IF the user provides invalid command-line arguments THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and usage instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want detailed logging and error reporting, so that I can troubleshoot issues with project analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide progress information about project discovery
2. WHEN errors occur during project file parsing THEN the system SHALL log specific error details
3. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL report summary statistics (projects found, dependencies analyzed, etc.)
4. WHEN verbose logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about each step
5. IF critical errors prevent completion THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate error codes
